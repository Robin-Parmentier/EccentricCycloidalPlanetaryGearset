# EccentricCycloidalPlanetaryGearset
Basic Fusion 360 plugin for generating an eccentric cycloidal planetary gearset.

The main assumption made by this plugin is that the end user will drive the sun gear, and use the planet carrier as the output. This guarantees the highest gear reduction for an eccentric cycloidal gearset.
Gear reduction can also be thought of as the number of planets, minus one.
